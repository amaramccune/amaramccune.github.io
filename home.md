Welcome! My name is Amara and I am a second year physics PhD student studying high energy theory at UCSB. This website serves as a tool for me to organize and write up my current research, notes on what I am learning, and papers that I am reading.

## About

Originally from Stoughton, Wisconsin, I have bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics from Stanford University, where I completed a variety of research projects in AMO, astrophysics, and cosmology. I also spent a summer at CERN as part of the University of Michigan REU program. 

## My Work

I am generally interested in developments in field theory and cosmological applications to physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter, the CMB, and inflation. My current projects focus on parity solutions to the strong CP problem and cosmological collider physics. 

## Course Notes

## Notes on Papers

## Outreach

I am a blogger for the gradudate student-run website ParticleBites. We write articles on recent developments in particle physics and summarize interesting concepts for an undergraduate-level audience. You can find my articles here: https://particlebites.com/?author=27

This past summer, I had the opportunity to volunteer as a teching fellow for the Mongolian Young Scholars Program (MYSP) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. I developed a week-long course on cosmology and served as a mentor to a group of 30 high school students. http://mysp.world/
